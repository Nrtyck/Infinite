# Infinite Example Game

This is a quick little game made in a couple of hours to test out the current state of [Infinite](https://github.com/Yousazoe/Infinite).



### Notes

Tested in Debug and Release. Open `Infinite.sln` and run the `Sandbox` project. Alternatively you can run `scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat` to generate new project files. The current commit is an *exact* submission of what I achieved within the video timeframe. I may modify this in the future to make it a little more polished, as well as provide a debrief of my experiences and what I think should be prioritized for Infinite's future development.

Infinite is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows.
